## Welcome to Python in Bioinformatics!

Bioinformatics is a vast field of biological computation, molecular aspects, genome based experiments, functional annotations of
different variations and biotechnology integrated with data science, machine learning in Python to curate the authentic biological data
and manage the processing of them to produce the reliable, resourceful and comprehensible insights for the research, company business requirements
or varous other pharma deliveries.

Python in Bioinformatics course is part of this field where it helps anyone from biology or computer science background to understand the
basic concepts of Python programming language while also delving into the world of bioinformatics. This creates the coordination of technology
with biological critical thinking to utilize our comprehensive skills throughout the learning from the beginning till the end of this course.

My programs are depicted in such a way that gives you an idea of how a bioinformatician would operate.
